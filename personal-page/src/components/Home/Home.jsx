          Little bit about myself: A goal-driven, communicative young
          professional, a graduate of International Business masterâ€™s degree,
          with more than 9-year international experience, primary in sales and
          commercial client support. Passionate about web-development and
          recently embarked on intensive bootcamp to further enhance skills in
          this field.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some of technologies that I had a chance to learn:</p>
        {Object.entries(technologyImage).map(
          ([technology, imageUrl], index) => (
            <TechImageCard
              key={index}
              imageSrc={imageUrl}
              altText={technology}
            />
          )
        )}
      </div>
    );
